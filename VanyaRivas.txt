Week 3:

10/11: Spent 1.5 hours reading up the different between Fragment vs support.v4.Fragment / SupportMapFragment vs MapFragment / Learned about OnMapReadyCallback
10/13: Spent an hour testing different ways to implement Google Maps in a fragment vs Activity
	Realized my anti virus (Kaspersky) was deleting java.exe from my computer after reinstalling the jre thinking it was a trojan #bless
10/14: Spent 2 hours - Implemented a map! Map now works.. almost done with obtaining user location --> Working on pins for map

Week 4:

10/18: Encountered road block with permissions and -- anti-virus deleting various components of jre; keep having to reinstall and ate up a lot of time...

10/20: Spent time reading up on user location permissions - accidentally learned about the inner mechanics of how permissions are looked up.
	- getContext() to overcome not an actual activiy
	- getMapAsync() (OnMapReadCallbak) covers deprecated getMap()
	- Marshmallow 6.0+ requires extra permission security, set sdk to >22 to "bypass"
10/21: Spent three hours 
	- Able to request permissions successfully for pre & post marshmallow update
	- Created markers with name and title; worked on view
	- Having trouble implementing token features on map outside of registered user gestures
	Need to check: Mapview vs and OnMapReady(GoogleMap map) ***
