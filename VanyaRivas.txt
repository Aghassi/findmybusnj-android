Week 1: (From log on the website)



9/26 - Installed and began to step through the "Introduction to Android Studio" tutorial.

9/27 - Finished "Introduction to Android Studio" tutorial and moved to reviewing first app "composr" created on old version of Android Studio for comparison.

9/28 - Continued stepping through "composr." Ran into problem with crashing emulator: fixed. Browsed forums (stackoverflow&googleblog) for solution. Found Genymotion: a plugin for Eclipse. Familiarized myself with iOS FindMyBusNJ structure. 



Week 2:



10/6 - 10/7: 


Extra notes (because commited prematurely):


- Manifest now has user permissions
	
- Internet, Read/Write External, Fine Location, Access
	
- Google Maps Key: AIzaSyCct5h4ncVFAs3bl31HTe9N5TNpN80iT6Y 

- Check for xml on google_maps_*
	
- Intents for new tabs (Search, Nearby)

- Next: Brute Force FragmentActivity (default maps) to Fragment (current Nearby Tab)

- How to make map only in Fragment.


Week 3:

10/11: Spent 1.5 hours reading up the different between Fragment vs support.v4.Fragment / SupportMapFragment vs MapFragment / Learned about OnMapReadyCallback
10/13: Spent an hour testing different ways to implement Google Maps in a fragment vs Activity
	Realized my anti virus (Kaspersky) was deleting java.exe from my computer after reinstalling the jre thinking it was a trojan #bless
10/14: Spent 2 hours - Implemented a map! Map now works.. almost done with obtaining user location --> Working on pins for map

Week 4:

10/18: Encountered road block with permissions and -- anti-virus deleting various components of jre; keep having to reinstall and ate up a lot of time...

10/20: Spent time reading up on user location permissions - accidentally learned about the inner mechanics of how permissions are looked up.
	- getContext() to overcome not an actual activiy
	- getMapAsync() (OnMapReadCallbak) covers deprecated getMap()
	- Marshmallow 6.0+ requires extra permission security, set sdk to >22 to "bypass"
10/21: Spent three hours 
	- Able to request permissions successfully for pre & post marshmallow update
	- Created markers with name and title; worked on view
	- Having trouble implementing token features on map outside of registered user gestures
	Need to check: Mapview vs and OnMapReady(GoogleMap map) ***

Week 5:
10/24: Received error with finding user location: conflict with types on mapview -->fragment vs mapview -->mapfragment
10/27: Slight change in plan: read up on correlation between emulators and android phone, 
	- accidentally reformatted own phone.....
	- Restarted the tab from scratch with clean code
10/28: it works on the phone but not on emulator. 
	- Problem: only gets user locaiton assuming you used a location necessary app.
	- Next: ^ Why. Also work on customization on map for name of areas + bus stop.

Week 6:
10/30: Learned about markers on Google Maps API and customization
11/1: FusedLocationApi covers deprecated Location Request and Location Services!!
11/4: Officially gets user location and marks with marker both on emulator and with Android phone.
	- started working on populating the map with nearby locations as given by database
Next: work on zoom function and visual flares. CONTINUE with populating the map

Week 7:
11/6-8: Read on retreiving JSON parsing and url connection on Android developer & looked at iOS version for reference + mobilesiri article
	- Tested using David's iOS code. retrieved information but unsure where to put.
11/7: Set up Android Studio for Android Wear emulator and tested sample code from android developer for 2 hours
11/11: Integrated new stable master with my stable tab -- unrecognized error appeared on Android Studio with problems regarding resources, 
 	will upload once error is resolved. Have spent 1.5 hours pinpointing exact problem. 
	Possibly a reinstall issue that was encountered aroudn October when I first tried to integrate two different versions
	- Location gps "deprecated" issue that isn't present in my solo version.

Week 8:
11/12: Morning - spent 2 hours on attempting JSON object request on separate class, Came to conclusion map has missing edge cases that won't work well with retreiving locations
11/13: Evening - spent ~2 hours on fixing nearby tab reaction to changing locations in order to facilitate the retrieval of locations
11/15: Evening - spent ~2 hours on Reading up on Android Wear about displaying information. attempted a tutorial from Android's developeed github
11/18: Afternoon/Evening - spent 5 hours on fixing nearby tab
	ACCOMPLISHED:
	- zoom on user location at start up
	- requests user for location permissions if not already given (occasionally crashed on fresh install?)
	- user can click and it will refresh the map fragment to flood with nearby stations (not yet in stable build)
	- user location tracked with blue dot
	- user defined clicked spot marked with Cyan Marker vs Red markers for JSON retreived areas.
	- ipon clicking new location, tapping on marker will give user option to navigate to desired area.
	- onResume, destruction of tab, Suspension of tab, and time out on tab will NO LONGER mess up the Map's location accuracy
	- *** Should ask for all permissions on main activity - Must wait till everyone has a stable tab
	- *** Ready for JSON retrieval shenanigans
Week 9: (Post Thanksgiving)
11/27: Evening - spent 2 hours following tutorial on post request for information. Implemented a rough outline on retreiving information to no avail.
		Left off on verbose catch exception for picking up on next time.
11/30: Afternoon - spent ~3 hours on revising outline for request. Reviewed David's stable code for retreiving information. Ran into a lot of errors.
		Also attempted to merge both stable sides but found an error in format for nearbytab that doesn't correlate to David's end.
12/1: Evening - spent 2~3 hours: fixing nearbytab format to match david's half. Will merge once JSON on nearbytab works.
		Emulator for Android Wear bugged out with update on platform-tools ver 25. Installation and relocation of files happened.
		Approached making Android Wear app wrong for about an hour. 
12/2: Evening - spent 3 hours: trial and error on JSON retreival of information. Set up an outline for putting the information for markers on map.
		should inundate map with markers once information is properly retreived.
		Put Permissions for Read and Write to external storage prompts for user.
	NEXT: 
	- push favorites from David's end to Android wear in a rudamentary manner. Nothing too fancy - Just alerts on favorited bus stops
	- Make it so permissions are asked at launch of app
	- JSON retreival feels very soon to done.
	- Pushed stable (not crash) version of Nearbytab with initial (wrong) outline to branch.
