10/18: Encountered road block with permissions and -- anti-virus deleting various components of jre; keep having to reinstall and ate up a lot of time...

10/20: Spent time reading up on user location permissions - accidentally learned about the inner mechanics of how permissions are looked up.
	- getContext() to overcome not an actual activiy
	- getMapAsync() (OnMapReadCallbak) covers deprecated getMap()
